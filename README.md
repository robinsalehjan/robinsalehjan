# ℹ️ About me
- I've been a professional software engineer since 2017, crafting delightful products using `C++`, `Objective-C`, and `Swift`, alongside developing backend-for-frontend services with `Java`/`Kotlin`, `TypeScript`, and `Python`. I also occasionally dabble in `Ruby`, `Bash`, and other suitable languages and tools 😄

# 💼 Current work
 - As a member of the horizontal platform team at [FINN](https://www.finn.no), I contribute and work on architecture, build optimizations, tooling, and feature modules for iOS, as well as backend-for-frontend services.
