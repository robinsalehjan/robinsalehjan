# ℹ️ About me
- I've been a professional software engineer since 2017, crafting delightful products using `Objective-C`, `Swift` along with backend-for-frontend services in `Java`/`Kotlin`, `TypeScript`, and `Python`. I occasionally dabble in other technologies such as `React`, `Elixir`, `Ruby` and any other suitable languages and tools😄

# 💼 Current work
 - As a contributor to the horizontal platform team at [FINN](https://www.finn.no), my work is focused on architecture, build and test optimizations, tooling and feature modules for iOS, as well as backend-for-frontend services with `Java`/`Kotlin`.
