# ℹ️ About me
- My name is Robin, I've been working as a software engineer since 2018. Creating delightful software for MacOS/iOS with `C++`, `Objective-C` and `Swift` along with backend-for-frontend services written in `Java`, `TypeScript` and `Python`. I also dabbled with `Bash`, `Ruby` and `React`; strive to use the correct tool in the toolbox to solve the problem at hand is my mantra 😃

# 💼 Current workplace
 - I work on architecture, build optimisations, tooling and features for iOS along with backend-for-frontend services at [FINN](https://www.finn.no).
